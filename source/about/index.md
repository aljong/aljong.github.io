# Hi there 🥝 I'm Kiwi!

I have fun breaking things and making them work in different ways. 

I'm an AI Red Teamer at an AI company in North Carolina. 

You'll notice that beyond this, there isn't much else about me on this site. I give this site out to everyone, so I try to make it somewhat non-trivial for bad faith actors to act in bad faith. If you cared enough, you'll find out who I am anyways though. Good luck!

# Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy:
- Playing PC Games. Current favourite game is [A Story About My Uncle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/278360/).
- Taking care of [Zuko](/assets/images/zuko2.png).
- Taking risks with people for shits and giggles.
- Organizing security conferences (DEF CON, BSIDES RDU, CackalackyCon, ShmooCon).
- Building [DEF CON Badges](https://defcon.social/@kiwi/110873356927779293) and convincing airline staff to [troll people.](https://x.com/_0xKiwi/status/1821035187595051139)
